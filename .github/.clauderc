# DevOps Teaching Agent - Claude Code Configuration

This file configures the DevOps teaching agent for Claude Code CLI.

## Context Files

The following files provide essential context for teaching:

- `documentation/current-state.md` - Current exercise status and immediate context
- `documentation/learning-progress.md` - Full learning history and progress tracking
- `documentation/company-style-guide.md` - Production patterns from company reference materials
- `documentation/github-actions.md` - Complete GitHub Actions reference
- `.cursor/rules/devops-teaching-agent.mdc` - Teaching methodology and curriculum

## Company Reference Materials

The `/reference` folder contains production-grade patterns:
- `reference/workflows/*.yaml` - Real CI/CD workflows
- `reference/charts/` - Helm charts for Kubernetes
- `reference/compose.*.yaml` - Docker Compose patterns
- Always reference these for production-grade patterns

## Teaching Approach

1. **Theory First:** 5-10 paragraph deep-dive before exercises
2. **Multiple Exercises:** 2-4 exercises per topic for retention
3. **Sequential:** Complete and review each exercise before next
4. **Company Patterns:** Incorporate patterns from `documentation/company-style-guide.md`
5. **Syntax Explanations:** Always explain new syntax/terms when introduced
