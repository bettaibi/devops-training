# Exercise 5A: Basic Docker Build & Push to GHCR
#
# GOAL: Build the 'web' component Docker image and push it to GitHub Container Registry
#
# This is the foundation exercise for Docker + GitHub Actions integration.
# You'll learn the essential pattern: setup → authenticate → build → push.
#
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Set up Docker Buildx for advanced builds
# - Authenticate with GHCR using GITHUB_TOKEN
# - Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile
# - Push the image to GitHub Container Registry
# - Apply basic tagging (branch name)
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# 1. Trigger on push to 'test-workflows' branch
# 2. Create job named 'build-and-push-web'
# 3. Run on ubuntu-latest runner
# 4. Set permissions: contents: read, packages: write
# 5. Steps required:
#    a) Checkout repository code
#    b) Set up Docker Buildx
#    c) Log in to GHCR (ghcr.io)
#       - username: github.actor
#       - password: GITHUB_TOKEN
#    d) Build and push image
#       - context: ./components/web
#       - file: ./components/web/Dockerfile
#       - push: true
#       - tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/devops-web:${{ github.ref_name }}
#       - Enable GitHub Actions cache (cache-from and cache-to with type=gha)
#
# HINTS:
# - Use actions/checkout@v4 for checkout
# - Use docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 for Buildx setup
# - Use docker/login-action@v3 for GHCR login
# - Use docker/build-push-action@v6 for build and push
# - github.repository_owner gives your GitHub username
# - github.ref_name gives the branch name (test-workflows)
# - For cache-to, use mode=max to cache all layers
#
# VERIFICATION:
# After pushing to test-workflows branch:
# 1. Check Actions tab - workflow should complete successfully
# 2. Check Packages tab in your GitHub profile
# 3. You should see 'devops-web' package with tag 'test-workflows'
