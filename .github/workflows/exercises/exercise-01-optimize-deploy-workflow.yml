# Exercise 1: Optimize Deploy Workflow
#
# GOAL: Fix and optimize the deploy-web-workflow.yml
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Use the correct version of actions/setup-node (v4, not v6)
# 2. Combine 'build' and 'test' into a single 'ci' job that:
#    - Runs tests first (npm test)
#    - Then builds (npm run build)
# 3. Add npm caching using the built-in cache feature
# 4. Keep the 'deploy' job dependent on the new 'ci' job
#
# Reference: ../../deploy-web-workflow.yml (original file)
#
