# Exercise 3: Caller Workflow
#
# GOAL: This workflow calls the reusable template you just created.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Use the 'push' trigger on 'test-workflows' branch
# 2. Define a job named 'call-build'
# 3. Use the 'uses' keyword to call './.github/workflows/exercises/reusable-build.yml'
# 4. Pass the following inputs:
#    - working_directory: './components/web'
#    - artifact_name: 'web-production-bundle'
# 5. Pass the secret 'DEPLOY_TOKEN' (you can just pass any string like 'dummy-token' for now)
#
