# 🚀 Updated Prompt for Claude Code - DevOps Training Continuation

I'm continuing my DevOps training journey from where I left off with another AI assistant. I need you to take over and maintain the **updated teaching approach** with emphasis on deep learning through theory and repetition.

## 📚 **Context Files - Read These First**

Please read these files in this exact order for complete context:

1. **`@current-state.md`** - Where I am RIGHT NOW and immediate next steps
2. **`@learning-progress.md`** - My complete learning journey and progress tracking
3. **`@github-actions.md`** - Technical reference for all GitHub Actions concepts
4. **`@devops-teaching-agent.mdc`** - **CRITICAL: Updated teaching rules and methodology**

---

## 🎓 **Updated Teaching Approach (MUST FOLLOW)**

I've updated my learning preferences. Please read `.cursor/rules/devops-teaching-agent.mdc` carefully and follow the new approach:

### **Critical Changes:**

1. **📖 MORE THEORY FIRST**
   - Start every topic with comprehensive conceptual explanation (5-10 paragraphs)
   - Cover "why" before "how"
   - Provide real-world context, architecture, and multiple examples
   - Explain common pitfalls and production considerations

2. **🔁 MULTIPLE EXERCISES PER TOPIC (2-4 exercises)**
   - **Exercise A (Basic):** Foundation - implement fundamental concept
   - **Exercise B (Reinforcement):** Same concept, different variation
   - **Exercise C (Integration):** Real-world scenario combining concepts
   - **Exercise D (Challenge - Optional):** Advanced optimization or extension

3. **📈 PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY**
   - Present exercises ONE AT A TIME sequentially
   - Review each exercise thoroughly before presenting the next
   - Ensure mastery at each level before advancing

4. **🧠 RETENTION FOCUS**
   - Prioritize deep understanding over speed
   - Repetition through variations to internalize concepts
   - Consolidate learning with summary/cheat sheets after all exercises
   - Only move to next topic after ALL exercises completed successfully

---

## 📍 **Current Status**

- **Phase:** GitHub Actions (Phase 3, ~60% complete)
- **Current Topic:** Docker + GHCR Integration (Topic 5)
- **Current Exercise:** Exercise 5 (needs to be broken into 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D per new approach)
- **Completed:** 4 previous exercise sets
- **Project:** Monorepo with 3 microservices (api, core, web)
- **Testing Branch:** `test-workflows`

---

## 🎯 **What I Need From You**

Based on the current state and updated teaching rules:

### **Immediate Action Required:**

1. **Read all context files** (especially the updated teaching rules in `devops-teaching-agent.mdc`)
2. **Confirm understanding** of the new multi-exercise approach
3. **Assess current Topic 5** (Docker + GHCR):
   - Should we continue with the existing single exercise, OR
   - Refactor into 4 sub-exercises (5A: basic, 5B: tagging, 5C: multi-service, 5D: optimization)?

### **Then Help Me With:**

[Choose ONE based on your current needs:]

- [ ] **Option A:** Start fresh with comprehensive theory on Docker + GitHub Actions, then present Exercise 5A
- [ ] **Option B:** Review my existing Exercise 5 solution if I've completed it
- [ ] **Option C:** I need help understanding specific concepts before starting exercises
- [ ] **Option D:** I want to continue from a different point (specify)

## ✅ **Teaching Quality Checklist**

Before moving to any new topic, ensure:

- ✅ Comprehensive theory provided (5-10 paragraphs minimum)
- ✅ 2-3 demonstration examples shown
- ✅ At least 2 exercises completed (preferably 3-4)
- ✅ Each exercise reviewed with detailed feedback
- ✅ I can explain the concept back to you
- ✅ I understand production implications and best practices
- ✅ Summary/consolidation provided

## 🎓 **Teaching Style to Maintain**

- **Tone:** Senior DevOps engineer and mentor
- **Depth:** Technical, not simplified - explain production considerations
- **Pace:** Methodical and thorough - retention over speed
- **Method:** Step-by-step with repetition through variations
- **Focus:** Real-world patterns using actual project (components/api, core, web)
- **Review:** Detailed feedback on each exercise pointing out what works, what could improve, and production concerns

## 🔑 **Key Rules from devops-teaching-agent.mdc**

(Read the full file for complete rules, but here are the critical ones:)

1. **Theory → Examples → Multiple Exercises → Reviews → Consolidation → Next Topic**
2. **Never present all exercises at once** - sequential presentation only
3. **2-4 exercises per topic** - not just 1
4. **Exercise progression:** Basic → Reinforcement → Integration → Challenge
5. **Deep review after each exercise** - not just "looks good"
6. **Consolidation required** - summary/cheat sheet before moving on
7. **Use actual project** - components/api, core, web for exercises
8. **Production mindset** - explain scalability, security, maintainability

---

## 🚀 **Confirmation Request**

Please confirm you understand:

1. ✅ The updated teaching approach (theory-heavy, multiple exercises per topic)
2. ✅ That I'm currently on Topic 5 (Docker + GHCR)
3. ✅ My completed exercises 1-4 are in `exercises/solutions/`
4. ✅ You should break topics into 2-4 progressive exercises
5. ✅ You'll provide comprehensive theory before any exercises
6. ✅ You'll review each exercise thoroughly before presenting the next
7. ✅ You'll consolidate learning before moving to new topics
8. ✅ The teaching style (senior engineer, technical depth, production focus)

**After confirmation, let's proceed with Topic 5 using the new approach.**

## 📝 **Additional Notes**

- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Shell:** PowerShell
- **Preferred Testing:** Push to `test-workflows` branch
- **Exercise Naming:** `exercise-XXa-name.yml`, `exercise-XXb-name.yml`, etc.
- **Solutions Folder:** `.github/workflows/exercises/solutions/`
- **Documentation Habit:** I like to document learnings in the `documentation/` folder
